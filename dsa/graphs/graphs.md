### Graphs

- Representation of graphs
``vector<vector<int>> g(_size_)`` or ``vector<int> g[]`` - can be represented as an array of vectors or as a vector of vectors.

- an edge in graph. Let's say between a-b entry in the graph would be happening to you

```c++
// entry in each others vector array
g[a].push_back(b);
g[b].push_back(a):
```

- "something" that needs to be discussed will be discussed here

```cpp
for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
    cout << "sometjing";
}
```
