- Reason for operating system to exists 
    - Resource mangement : We have limited resource for a particular machine. it manages which application or process to run in backgroud. handles
                           multiple applications.
    - Abstraction : operating system extracts the hardware ( talks to them), we don't need to write machine/binary code. It provides system calls to
                    the library, using which application development becomes easier
    - Protection : protects application from each other, protects from malware. kind of system manager

#### Types of Operating systems
- Single tasking 
- Mutli-programming and Mutli-tasking 
- Multi-threading
- Multi-processing

#### single tasking :
    - very basic/simple operating systems
    - only one process can exists in RAM and can run at a time 
    - cons : CPU has to sit ideal during IO
    - ex. MS DOS
