- Reason for operating system to exists 
    - Resource mangement : We have limited resource for a particular machine. it manages which application or process to run in backgroud. handles
                           multiple applications.
    - Abstraction : operating system extracts the hardware ( talks to them), we don't need to write machine/binary code. It provides system calls to
                    the library, using which application development becomes easier
    - Protection : protects application from each other, protects from malware. kind of system manager
